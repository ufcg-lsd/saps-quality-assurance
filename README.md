# End to end test using NOP algorithms

## Overview

The NOP end-to-end tests are used to test the full execution of the SAPS workflow regardless the complexity of the Inputdownload, preprocesssing and processing scripts. With this in mind, the NOPs algorithms, for each one of the three SAPS workflow steps, execute minimaly simple implementations. See below how to configure them and also an overview of their internals.

## NOP tests

There are three sets of implementations of NOP algorithms for the SAPS workload: `nop`, `nop-fake-files`, `nop-download-files`. The `nop` implementation executes nothing, it simply returns an exit code indicating success. The `nop` set is a good choice for a very fast end-to-end test. The `nop-fake-files` set also returns success but generates fake output data. This set helps testing the data SAPS data transfer features. Finally, the `nop-download-files` generates a output dataset, but differenlty from the previously set, the dataset are downloaded from an external repository (it could be useful to check SAPS access to external networks). See below the instructions for performing the tests, using these algorithms, via CLI.

### 1. NOP

Run the following command inside the `saps-engine` dir:

```bash
bash bin/submit-task <user-email> <user-paswword> -7.413 -7.047 -37.314 -36.257 2015-06-23 2015-06-23 nop nop nop <dispatcher-access-ip>:<dispatcher-access-port>
```

### 2. NOP-FAKE-FILE

Run the following command inside the `saps-engine` dir:

```bash
bash bin/submit-task <user-email> <user-paswword> -7.413 -7.047 -37.314 -36.257 2015-06-23 2015-06-23 nop-fake-files nop-fake-files nop-fake-files <dispatcher-access-ip>:<dispatcher-access-port>
```

### 3. NOP-DOWNLOAD-FILES

Run the following command inside the `saps-engine` dir:

```bash
bash bin/submit-task <user-email> <user-paswword> -7.413 -7.047 -37.314 -36.257 2015-06-23 2015-06-23 nop-download-files nop-download-files nop-download-files <dispatcher-access-ip>:<dispatcher-access-port>
```

# End to end test using real algorithms

## Overview

This report described how to test SAPS using fully implemented algorithm (based on the googleapis inputdownloading, default preprocessing e ufcg-sebal processing algorithms). Below, we give an overview of the SAPS processing flow, on how SAPS should be configured to perform the tests, on how to submit the test, and how to check the correctness of the output generated by the algorithms.

## Test execution flow

![Test flow](img/end-to-end-test-flow.png)

1. User submits a task (new processing) to the Dashboard
2. Dashboard forwards the processing request to the Dispatcher
3. Dispatcher adds new processing information to the Catalog
4. Scheduler retrieves the new information entered for processing
5. Scheduler submits the task to a Job Execution Service that will process the scripts
6. Archiver retrieves information already processed for archiving the resulting data
7. Archiver sends data to Permanent Storage
8. User requests the completed task data
9. Dashboard forwards the order to the Dispatcher
10. Dispatcher generates links to access Permanent Storage of job data
11. Dispatcher sends an email to the User with access links

## Configuration

It is necessary to configure the scripts that will be used by the SAPS pipeline to be able to produce the same result expected by the test, for that, we must configure three components to recognize these test scripts.

**Note: After the changes, it is necessary to restart the components**

### Configuring Dashboard

In the [SAPS script file](https://github.com/ufcg-lsd/saps-dashboard/tree/master/public/dashboardApp.js) replace the value of the variable `scriptsTags` by:

```javascript
let scriptsTags = 
{
"inputdownloading":[
    {
      "name": "endtoend-test",
      "docker_tag": "endtoend-test",
      "docker_repository": "fogbow/inputdownloading"
    }
  ],
  "preprocessing":[
    {
      "name": "endtoend-test",
      "docker_tag": "endtoend-test",
      "docker_repository": "fogbow/preprocessor"
    }
  ],
  "processing":[
    {
      "name": "endtoend-test",
      "docker_tag": "endtoend-test",
      "docker_repository": "fogbow/worker"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Test execution

### Via Dashboard

#### 1. Login to the Dashboard

![Login Dashboard](img/end-to-end-test-run-img1.png)

Access the GUI through the url ```$dashboard_access_ip:$dashboard_access_port``` and connect using valid credentials.

#### 2. Create new processing

![New processing](img/end-to-end-test-run-img2.png)

When connecting successfully, click on `New Processing`, fill in the fields as in the image above and click on `Process`

#### 3. New processing created

![New processing created](img/end-to-end-test-run-img3.png)

After a few seconds, it will be possible to observe the image above, that is, two new processes have been created and are in the initial state (`Created`), wait for at least half an hour until they are completed.

#### 4. Processing completed

![Processing completed](img/end-to-end-test-run-img4.png)

After the two processes are completed, the GUI will be similar to the image above, one with LANDSAT 8 with a successful end state (`Success`) and the other with LANDSAT 7 with a failed end state (`Failure`).

### Via CLI

Run the following code inside the saps-engine project folder:

```
bash bin/submit-task <user email> <user paswword> -7.413 -7.047 -37.314 -36.257 2015-06-23 2015-06-23 endtoend-test endtoend-test endtoend-test <dispatcher address>
```

**Note: `<dispatcher address>` includes both the VM IP together with the access port, for example, `localhost:9000`.**

## Download files for verification of results

### Via Dashboard

#### 1. Dashboard data tab

![Data tab](img/end-to-end-test-check-results-img1.png)

In the data tab, fill in the fields as shown in the image above and click on `Search`.

#### 2. Email notification

![Send email](img/end-to-end-test-check-results-img2.png)

After completing the search, the result shown in the image above will be displayed, check the option with the information of the processing done and click on `Send email`.

#### 3. Download URLs

Check your inbox, SAPS will prepare several links to download data for the completed task.

### Via CLI

Run the following command within your `saps-engine` directory:

```bash
bash bin/get-task-links <user email> <user password> <task id> <dispatcher address>
```

**Note: `<task id>` can be found by running the `get-all-tasks` CLI as follows:**

```bash
bash bin/get-all-tasks <user email> <user password> <dispatcher address>
```

**Note: <dispatcher address> follows the same format as IP:PORT**
